Data-Product
============

This repository contains all the relevant documentation and code to support the Bitcoin Profitability Shiny App. This application has been developed for the Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization from Coursera. 

The the purpose of the App is to assist users to estimate the future Bitcoin network difficulty and assess profitability based on the current hashrate of their mining equipment. To accomplish this, the App downloads all previous network difficulty figures directly from the network (http://blockexplorer.com/q/nethash). Based on the user input, the App forecasts the accrued profitability for a two year period.
